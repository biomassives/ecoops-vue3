    <h1>Training</h1>

    SCD Hub provides research and training support for Eco Ops programs and partner organizations.
    The approach is to develop circular economies that are linked together through the common goals
    of creating meaningful employment, reducing waste, restoring damaged environments, improving
    access to hands on education in schools and lowering the social and environmental impacts of
    modern society and its intersection with traditional societies wishing to retain knowledge and
    customs.
